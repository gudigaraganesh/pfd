pfd - precision farming devices


Belonging to  Agriculture and Artist family, it was my
dream to develop some solutions for Agriculture as a profitable
industry for farmers.
Early days before I enter into IT industry, i was helping my parents
in diferent aspects in farming. We used to grow jasmin and
supply this to nearest flower market.


I know the difficulties my mother went through using
the chemical fertilizers for more yield of jasmin.


After joining IT industry, my most experience was
in embedded domain and this helped me to come up
with a concept of developing device and software
for solving issues in agriculture.

Along with this i also got  opportunity to work with some
very good Professors from Indian Institute of Science in Aerospace
and Weather Technology. I also travelled to ISRO's Sriharikota
Satellite Center to fix and design new features for Weather Station software used to monitor different environment conditions alongside of rocket
launching station.

I also conducted seminar on "importance of wireless sensors in
precision farming" in UAS(University of Agriculture Sciences),Bangalore.

I also spent time with Late Prof Jangnath Rao, top Agriculture
scientist of india and submitted a proposal for "wireless sensors
in agriculture" for Indo US technology forum.



worked on developing weather stations with different technologies, integrating    sensors, control panels, web solutions, remote loggers etc.
 
Worked in integrating sensors which are connected UART/modbus/RS485 to
remote weather control panel based on microcontroller, x86 board and
send data from field logger to remote Control station over
RS485 or ethernet.

Also worked on developing 
1. serial to industrial ethernet module
2. serial to bluetooth moduler
3. serial to wifi module
4. serial to sub 1Ghz RF module - like zigbee, 6lowpan, custom mesh.

5. developing complete new ARM based sensor modules using
wireless sensor networking capabilities- Nirmitsu Technologies

6. Developed CAN based stack for Weather station local logging
devices - Smartpath infosystems india.

7.developmnet of drone software for agriculture technology
- smartpath infosystems india


About this work
---------------

This project of precision farming is started in my free time
in one week ends to develop device based software of
server based software for agriculture industry.

1. This software will take all sensor inputs and stores in database
2. this software will generate a report on regular basis for
the incoming data with some emperical formulas.
3. this software was developed in 2004 and lags lot of
technology related advancements, but can be easily migrated
to new echnology.
4. this software will also helps in generating caliberation
errors.
5.this software is aimed at designing a pluggable architecture
for integrating sensors.

Aim of the project
---------------------

what is precision farming ?
----------------------------
producing more food with leass resources using modern day
technologies like smart sensors, satellites, modern machenaries,
high end analytics applications, biological and organical way of
 soil fertility, proper monitor and control devices,
yield management and predictability of food production.

Managing the variations in "filed" very efficiently and
growing more food without using traitional approaches of last
10,000 years and looking from new view of thought.

also look at presentation in the same docs folder.

Variations impacting field
---------------------------
1. Environment conditions and soil ferility
   monitoring different parameters of enivronment and
regular soil tests will help the farmers to deliver the
some what predictable yields in the field. These are
the major variation components.
   a. Water 
	i. quantity
	ii. quality
	iii.  availability
	iv. Rain fall
	v. Dew
   
   b. Temperature
   c. Humidity
   d. Wind speed and Direction
   e.Solar Radiation
   f. CO2 and O2
   g.Soil Temperature
   g. Soil Moisture
   h. Soil Chemical compositiona
   i. Air temperature and Co2 composition.
   h. leaf water sensing, root water sensing, water level etc
	

Above parameters will help in getting some sense
of properties of filed on which farmer wants to
grow "specific yield"



2. location awareness and Season

Along  with sensing the filed parameters we also
need to know the season and date/time detaisl and
location awareness of the farming filed.

a.need to get exact location in a region and
always given seaon, given location and sensor
parameters will allow farmers to grow specific  yield
on his/her filed to get maximum output.

b. nned to maintain seasonal database with location
awareness for the region

c. along with this getting variation of filed with
local gis generation software for bigger land is required.
But for india, most of the lands are split lands this
may not be greater issue.
But still generating a local map with  handheld device
is a good requirements.


3. Pest Control

development of pest control devices is a must required
and understanding location based pest attack database
is must required feature.
Now a days biological pest control system is becoming more famous.

4. organic farming
using organic fertilizrs to increase soil fertiliation is
must required adaption to produce more food

5. open filed analysis
a
development of agriculture application with integrated
analytics by taking above all inputs and generating
proper yiled production guidelines has to take place.
This analysis requires different angle of view for
open filed and green house.

6. yield management

yield management is a huge subject in precision farming
for eacg crio.

a, crio based yield analysis for location, season adn filed
b. crop based pests anaysis and control
c. crop based resource analysis.
c.crop based sugession for given field to grow predictable
yield in high volume.
d. crop based supply chain evaluation.
e. crop based storage and delivery system design.
f. generation of proper historical data, reports and
guidance for crops on social networks or any other
 form of media.


7. greenhouse, roof  top farming, indoor farming in rooms using
grow lights, requires high end technology to produce
proper yield.



what is the aim of pfd
-------------------------
1. develop framework for microcontrollers and devices for
agriculture monitoring and utilitze IOT framework.

2. develop mobile applications for
    a. data collection
	b. map management
	c, tuked management inputs
	d. communication to drones for sensor and air survellence data
	e. communication to web server to get
	proper input/guidelines to farmer.
	f. integration to delivery and storage infrasture.
	f. all events management
	g. controlling devices like water pumps, sprinklers and
	 other remote agriculture related devices.
	i. using RFID based or guard monitoring devices
	for detection of animals, intruders and mobile
	phones communicate to these devices to get
	alert to farmer.

3. development cloud based Agriculture Analytics and monitoring
spftware/
This spftware will have flexible way to add module
fpr each yield and its analytics components.

4. drone for air survellence or local survellence

this will capture photos and communicate sensors on filed
to get information on periodic basis and communicates
to precision farming devices and server.


what is the difficulties in india
-----------------------------------
india faces split land problems like farming lands
mostly very small ranging from 1 acre to 10 acre.
There are large land farmers are there but most of the
 farming lands are already split. Most of European and
 US  technologies used for large land farming.
The model technologies we can view is the  Isralian agriculture
technology.
Since we are using split farming lands farmer will not be
able to offord high cost of software/sensors and
technology implementations.
To solve this problem india should adapt "Corporate farming"
or Cooperative farming.
1. use of coproorate or cop[erative farming can introduce
new cooperative or corporate organization which will
work on profit share basis model for utilizing the
farm land of farmer along with giving him opportunity to
work in his farm.
2. Since corporate or cooperate farming is handling bigger
lands, we can also use technology in farming by
developing local centers for data communication to
cloud servers.
3. Development of Cloud services on public cloud like AWS,google,Bluemix
or Azure or utilizing private cloud setup in each District,
State and National also can solve the problem to
develop a unique data gathering/ analytics servers.
3. Develop subscription based  IOT sensor devices and handhelds, control
devices will allow company's provide a device hub for
farmers on  getting a percentage of their profit.
4. develop Advertisment and entertainment based models
to help the companies to get more revenue by providing
free cloud services or device to farmers. The profits
can be achieved by charging more on entertainment or other
services.

5. Since recent emergence of 4G and low cost launch of data/voice/sms
services will help farmer in saving their networking costfor
utilizing agro services.
